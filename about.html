	<!-- Paragraphs -->
	<p>I’m an undergraduate Pure Mathematics student at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley minoring in Astronomy, and a psychology student at Southern New Hampshire University. I’m interested either pursuing research regarding astrophysics, or mathematical research, emphasizing in Mathematical Analysis and Topology.

	My main hobbies would be summarized in running, reading, watching anime and solving Rubik’s Cubes. Although I consider solving Rubik’s Cubes as my favorite hobby, since I was already an enthusiast since I was a child.
